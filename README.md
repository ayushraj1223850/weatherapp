# WeatherApp

This is a simple Weather application built using react.js. It fetches weather data from an external API and displays it to the user based on their location or a searched city.

## Features

* **Current Location Weather:** Automatically detects the user's current location and displays the weather information.
* **City Search:** Allows users to search for weather information by city name.
* **Weather Details:** Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description.
* **Responsive Design:** Works across various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

* React.js
* CSS and Material UI
* JavaScript
* Weather API (OpenWeatherMap)

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ayushraj1223850/weatherapp.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/ayushraj1223850/weatherapp.git)
    ```

2.  **Open `index.html` in your web browser.**

3.  **API Key (Important):**
    * This application requires an API key from a weather service provider. You will need to obtain one from a service like OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI.
    * Once you have your API key, you will need to insert it into the Javascript code. Look for where the API key is used, and replace the placeholder with your actual key.
    * Example using OpenWeatherMap:
        ```javascript
        const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"; // Replace with your actual API key
        ```

## Usage

1.  **Current Location:**
    * If your browser allows location access, the app will automatically display the weather for your current location.

2.  **City Search:**
    * Enter the city name in the search bar and press Enter or click the search button.
    * The app will fetch and display the weather information for the specified city.

## API Usage

This application uses a weather API to fetch weather data. The specific API used (OpenWeatherMap) will depend on the implementation within the JavaScript code. Please refer to the JavaScript code for details on the API endpoints and parameters used.
